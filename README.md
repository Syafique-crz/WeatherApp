‚Üí Overview

WeatherApp is a Java-based desktop application that provides real-time weather information for any user-specified location. The app dynamically fetches temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and air quality data using external APIs. Its intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) is built with Java Swing to deliver a smooth user experience.
